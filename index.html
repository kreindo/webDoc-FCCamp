        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          So you heard about this "really hard" modpack that takes Gregtech to
          the Nth degree and want to join in on the fun? Well first let's sit
          down and talk about what GTNH is and isn't, and who this modpack
          targets.
        </p>
        <h3>Philosophy of this modpack</h3>
        <p>
          GTNH is about taking the usual modball of magic and tech mods and
          making all the recipes Greg-ified. This means there's really nothing
          easy any more. All recipes are gated and modified - even vanilla ones.
          Even a door will need advanced tools you won't get until the Steam era
          at least. That means lots of hard work.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also means a major sense of accomplishment when you open that gate
          to the next stage. Getting ingredients to make your first decent food.
          Making your Electric Blast Furnace. Your first Thaumcraft wand.
          Launching your first rocket. Building a full scale chemical refinery.
          Instead of simply being a minor event in a game, each of these becomes
          moments of joy that you have now reached the next level.
        </p>
        <h3>Target audience</h3>
        <p>
          As stated above, this modpack is for people who enjoy hard challenges,
          and are willing and able to commit serious amounts of time to them. At
          the beginning, this may mean hours of searching for the right ores.
          Later on you'll spend time building and rebuilding your technology
          infrastructure to handle the latest resource demand. By the end,
          you'll practically have degrees in Gregtech chemical and electrical
          engineering - even a mage needs a technological base to supply
          resources!
        </p>
        <p>
          By its nature, this pack works best on servers, where players can work
          together to search for resources and share information. Playing SP is
          inherently more difficult since every orevein must be found solely by
          you. You are welcome to come to the Discord and commiserate with all
          the other players who have spent hours searching for that one
          redstone/lapis/mica/nickel vein.

        <p>
          Because of the amount of mods included, starting GTNH can take much
          longer than other modpacks. On lower end PCs, 30 minute start times
          are normal. On even high end PCs, expect 5 minute start times. If
          Minecraft looks like it has locked up, wait a few more minutes. Low
          End PCs has tips and configuration suggestions to help with playing on
          potato-PCs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, default Java parameters usually don't work well, so its best to
          optimize your memory setup and other configuration options.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have problems installing the modpack, have a look at Installing
          and Migrating.
        </p>
        <h3>First Day</h3>
        <p>
          Fair warning, nights in GTNH are *dark* (gamma correction is disabled,
          on purpose). And you won't get torches until well into the game. And
          there are terrifying Infernal mobs that can do nasty things to you.
          Expect to wall yourself in a hole in the ground during the night until
          you get your first bed. Torches will be in short supply until your
          first coke oven. (Tip. to have only a tiny bit of orientation in your
          absolute dark dirt shack, press f7 to know where the floor is). If
          you're lucky and find a coal vein, you can smelt the ore to make coal
          for torches. There is also a guide on the Questing Mechanics.
        </p>
        <h3>Starting Location</h3>
        <p>
          The most important decision in the game is choosing where to start. If
          you're a beginner, look for these important factors when choosing a
          new place to start.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Near water: With no infinite water, until you get a Railcraft Water
            Tank, you will be making frequent trips to fetch water. Make sure
            the water is large enough, at least 60 blocks. Being near a river is
            good for setting up kinetic water generators later, but not
            necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Near sand: You will need sand for many of the early multiblock
            recipes, and for glass. Later you can automate creating it from
            cobblestone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Near exposed minerals: This is difficult in GTNH since ores spawn in
            veins. Sometimes you might get lucky and find a vein on the surface,
            but it's pretty unlikely. Always mark any you find.
          </li>
          <li>Near a lava pool: Handy for refilling your smeltery.</li>
          <li>
            Villages: A great place to setup a base. Villages however should be
            avoided until you have a bed, otherwise the villagers will be
            slaughtered while you hole up at night. Steal a door - you won't get
            one until you smelt iron. Walled villages are especially good if you
            can light them up inside the walls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roguelike Dungeons: The large brick buildings on the surface, with a
            bed and furnace, perfect for starting a base. The stairs down can be
            blocked off to prevent monsters from coming up. Also, the bricks can
            be cannibalized later for multiblock structures. You can cheese the
            dungeon by going down with only torches and lighting it all up
            before returning for loot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wood: No duh! You will probably need more than 7 stacks for the
            first 3 tiers (mostly for charcoal, paper and chests). Some great
            biomes to look for are the Jungle biome, any type of forest (the
            dense or ones with big trees are especially great), and most of all,
            the sacred spring, Wich has massive trees but is a rather rare
            biome.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wet and mid-temperature biomes (NOT desert or anything snowy): This
            will help greatly with gathering water in the first couple ages. The
            railcraft water tank auto-fills with water over time, and the speed
            of this is heavily affected by the biome. Swampy is best for this
            reason and a few others (better for IC2 crops, clay sources, ect.).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Look for a location relatively flat, near sand, with good access to a body of water. Minerals will have to be searched for no matter what, and with a relatively flat location it makes it easier to get around. If possible, be relatively near an oil spout - ~128 blocks. If you are closer, cover the spout with dirt/cobble roof. Lightning or infernal mobs can set it on fire.</p>
